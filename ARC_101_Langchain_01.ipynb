    "### **What is RAG? (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  \n",
    "**RAG** is a technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by dynamically retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge source (like a database or documents) and feeding it into the LLM to generate more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as giving an LLM a \"search engine\" to look up facts before answering, instead of relying solely on its pre-trained memory (which can be outdated or incomplete).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How RAG Works (Step-by-Step)**  \n",
    "1. **User Query**: You ask a question (e.g., *\"What is the capital of France?\"*).  \n",
    "2. **Retrieval**:  \n",
    "   - RAG searches a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia, your documents, a database) for snippets relevant to the query.  \n",
    "   - Uses **vector similarity** (e.g., embeddings) to find the best matches.  \n",
    "3. **Augmentation**: The retrieved snippets are added to the LLM’s prompt as context.  \n",
    "4. **Generation**: The LLM generates an answer **based on the retrieved context**, not just its internal knowledge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why RAG is Powerful**  \n",
    "| **Traditional LLM** | **RAG-Augmented LLM** |\n",
    "|---------------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| Relies only on pre-trained knowledge (static). | Combines pre-trained knowledge + dynamic retrieval. |\n",
    "| Prone to hallucinations (making up facts). | More factual (grounded in retrieved documents). |\n",
    "| Can’t answer questions about recent/post-training events. | Can fetch up-to-date info (e.g., news, latest research). |\n",
    "| Generic responses. | Context-aware, domain-specific answers. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Examples of RAG**  \n",
    "1. **Chatbot for Company Docs**:  \n",
    "   - Retrieves internal HR policies before answering employee questions.  \n",
    "2. **Medical Assistant**:  \n",
    "   - Looks up the latest research papers to answer a doctor’s query.  \n",
    "3. **Customer Support**:  \n",
    "   - Pulls product manuals to troubleshoot issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Components of RAG**  \n",
    "1. **Retriever**:  \n",
    "   - Searches a knowledge base (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Elasticsearch).  \n",
    "   - Uses **embeddings** (vector representations of text) to find similar content.  \n",
    "2. **Generator (LLM)**:  \n",
    "   - Takes the retrieved context + user query to generate an answer.  \n",
    "   - Popular choices: Mistral, GPT-4, Llama 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use RAG**  \n",
    "✅ You need **domain-specific** answers (e.g., legal, medical, technical docs).  \n",
    "✅ Your data changes **frequently** (e.g., stock prices, news).  \n",
    "✅ You want to **reduce hallucinations** in LLM outputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Not needed for generic tasks (e.g., brainstorming, simple chat).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations of RAG**  \n",
    "- **Speed**: Retrieval adds latency vs. pure LLM inference.  \n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Quality**: Garbage in → garbage out.  \n",
    "- **Complexity**: Requires setting up retrievers/vector databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: RAG vs. Non-RAG**  \n",
    "**Query**: *\"What is LangChain?\"*  \n",
    "- **Non-RAG LLM**: Might give a generic definition based on pre-2023 training data.  \n",
    "- **RAG-Augmented LLM**:  \n",
    "  1. Searches LangChain’s latest documentation.  \n",
    "  2. Finds the 2024 API updates.  \n",
    "  3. Generates a precise, up-to-date answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced RAG Techniques**  \n",
    "- **HyDE**: Hypothetical Document Embeddings (generate fake \"ideal\" docs to improve retrieval).  \n",
    "- **Query Rewriting**: Refine the user’s query for better retrieval.  \n",
    "- **Re-Ranking**: Re-order retrieved docs to prioritize the best ones.  "

    "### **Key Concepts Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Why Split Text?**\n",
    "- **LLM Context Limits**: Models like Mistral-7B have finite context windows (e.g., 4k-8k tokens). Large documents must be split to fit.\n",
    "- **Retrieval Precision**: Smaller chunks improve search accuracy in RAG (matching user queries to relevant snippets).\n",

    "|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Recursive** (default) | Preserves paragraphs/sentences naturally. | Slightly slower.              |\n",
    "| `CharacterTextSplitter` | Faster, simpler.                          | May split mid-sentence.       |\n",
    "| `TokenTextSplitter`     | Accurate for token-limited models.        | Requires tokenizer overhead.  |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Parameter Choices**\n",
    "- **`chunk_size=500`**  \n",
    "  - Balances detail and usability:  \n",
    "    - Too small (e.g., 100 chars): Loses broader context.  \n",
    "    - Too large (e.g., 1k chars): May exceed LLM context limits in RAG.  \n",
    "  - **Rule of Thumb**: ~1-2 paragraphs or 3-5 sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`chunk_overlap=50`**  \n",
    "  - Prevents \"context fragmentation\" at chunk boundaries.  \n",
    "  - Example: If a key fact appears at the end of one chunk, the overlap ensures it’s also at the start of the next.  \n",
    "  - **Rule of Thumb**: 10-20% of `chunk_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. What Happens Under the Hood?**\n",
    "1. **Splitting Hierarchy**:  \n",
    "   The splitter recursively tries to divide text by:  \n",

    "### **Key Components Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding Model (`OllamaEmbeddings`)**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Converts text into dense vector representations (typically 384-4096 dimensions)\n",
    "   - **Model Choice**: Mistral is used here because:\n",
    "     - Balances speed and accuracy\n",
    "     - Optimized for semantic similarity tasks\n",
    "     - Runs efficiently on local hardware\n",
    "   - **How It Works**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Example embedding generation\n",
    "     vector = embeddings.embed_query(\"What is RAG?\")\n",
    "     # Returns: [0.23, -0.45, 0.72, ...] (list of floats)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FAISS Vector Store**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Enables fast similarity search over vectors\n",
    "   - **Optimizations**:\n",
    "     - Uses inverted indexes for efficient lookup\n",
    "     - Compresses vectors to reduce memory usage\n",
    "     - Supports GPU acceleration\n",
    "   - **Storage Structure**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     FAISS Index:\n",
    "     - Document 1: [0.1, 0.5, ...] → Metadata: {source: \"wiki\"}\n",
    "     - Document 2: [0.3, -0.2, ...] → Metadata: {source: \"wiki\"}\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "| Parameter          | Recommended Value  | Impact                                                                 |\n",

    "### **Alternative Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Other Vector Stores**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Pinecone (cloud-based)\n",
    "   from langchain_community.vectorstores import Pinecone\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Chroma (local)\n",
    "   from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Search**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Combine vector + keyword search\n",
    "   retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(\n",
    "       search_type=\"similarity_score_threshold\",\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Debugging Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Embedding Quality**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   test_query = \"What is a language model?\"\n",
    "   test_vector = embeddings.embed_query(test_query)\n",
    "   print(f\"Vector dim: {len(test_vector)}, sample: {test_vector[:3]}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Index Contents**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(f\"Index contains {vectorstore.index.ntotal} vectors\")\n",
    "   print(vectorstore.docstore._dict)  # Inspect stored documents"

      " In the context provided, there's no direct mention or usage of \"RAG\" related to large language models (LLMs). However, it's essential to note that when evaluating and comparing LLMs, metrics like cross-entropy, bits per word (BPW), and bits per character (BPC) are often used. These metrics help assess the model's performance in various aspects such as prediction accuracy and compression capability. If you were referring to a different acronym related to evaluating or training LLMs, I would need additional context to provide an accurate answer.\n",
      " The RAG system, which stands for Reiter's Affective Graph model, is not explicitly mentioned or applied with large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs in the given context. However, the general approach to working with LLMs involves providing prompts that guide their responses, similar to how a prompt can be used to elicit an affective response from the RAG system. The difference is that the RAG system uses predefined rules to analyze text and determine its emotional tone, whereas LLMs learn these patterns from data they are trained on. In both cases, the goal is to elicit or guide appropriate responses based on the input provided.\n"
